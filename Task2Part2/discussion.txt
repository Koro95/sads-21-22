Most expensive/fastest solution:
	- every task (except recording) executed on the largest cloud resource (cpTwoLarge)
	- cpTwoLarge has highest cost, but best performance
	- therefore implementation has highest cost and smallest makespan
	- logical solution if we only care about makespan --> choose resource with best performance
	
Cheapest/slower solution:
	- every task (except recording) executed on cheapest fog/edge resource (router)
	- router doesn't have cost in specification, so cheapest resource, but bad performance
	- therefore implementation has cheapest cost and longest makespan
	- logical solution if we only care about cost --> execute everything on bought fog/edge resource
	
------------------------------
NOTES:
CostEvaluator:
	- Communication Tasks --> If links of routing have cost, add them for each transmission
	- Computation Tasks:
		- Add cloud cost every time with cost * performance
		- Add fog/edge to Set and only add cost of each bought resource once at the end

TimingEvaluator:
	- Algorithm from lecture:
		1. Check if all predecessors finished
		2. Set start time as latest predecessor finish time
		3. Calculate own finish time
		4. Repeat until all tasks have finish time
